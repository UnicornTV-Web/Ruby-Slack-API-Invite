# Programmatically Send Slack Invitations

This little script and [accompanying screencast](https://ruby.unicorn.tv/screencasts/automatically-send-slack-invitations)
will help you automatically send slack invitations programmatically.

## Note

This endpoint is not officially supported by the Slack API. This is an internal endpoint they are using on their own
"invite users" page. I cannot guarantee that this endpoint will work, nor that Slack will be okay with anyone using it.
Use at your own risk!
